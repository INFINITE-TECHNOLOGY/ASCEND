## Purpose

`Ascend` is a step-up on-demand Cloud Security abstraction layer provider.

With `Ascend` it is no longer needed to hard-wire the business application with security framework.

Even legacy unsecured intranet APIs can now be secured with `Ascend` and published into the cloud.

On top of that `Ascend` is built around `Step-up` authorization - making it an ideal tool for securing 
Web Banking apps.

`Ascend` supports `OAuth2` as well as any possible protocol (including proprietary) encapsulated in its advanced innovative 
Web Token format.

## In short

'Ascend' allows to create and validate cryptographic credentials used to provide a Client Software (Apps) the permission
to access secured Web Services within the scope of their user authority.

`Ascend` fulfils `Authorization Server` role in `OAuth2` terminology.

`Ascend` is consists of:
1) Authorization Granting Server - issuing JWTs
2) Authorization Validation Server - validating JWTs and acting as reverse proxy.
