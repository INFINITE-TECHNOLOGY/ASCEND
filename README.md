`Ascend` is a revolutionary Web Security framework, built on top of [JWT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token).

`Ascend` JWT represents an [ACID](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSGMCP_5.4.0/product-overview/acid.html)-compliant 
Authorization [transaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction), containing sufficient information for validation of an HTTP request.

No longer the `Authorization Header` has only `Authentication` or partial Authorization data - with `Ascend` it is what it was intended to be. 

`Ascend` provides:

- Authorization Granting Server
    - App2app authentication
    - User2app authentication
    - Issuing Authorization JSON Web Tokens
- Authorization Validation Server
    - Autonomously validates HTTP Requests authorized using `Ascend Granting Server`
- Client SDK
    - Provides an API for simple communication with `Ascend Granting Server`
